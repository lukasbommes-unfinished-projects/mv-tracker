Task: Visual Object Tracking
- Liu 2019: OTCD
- Alvar 20018: 
    Name: MV-YOLO
    Type: Hybrid (both MVs and RGB Frame are used for Tracking)
    Codec used: HEVC
    Method:
      In every tracking step the method moves ROI pixels of the target in frame t-1 based on the MVs which correspond to those pixels. The minimum bounding rectangle of these pixels is used to create an ROI in frame t. YOLO object detector is used on the 
    Experiments:

- Classic methods for TRACKING that do not use any modern object detector
   - Gül 2016: HVEC, hybrid, combines pixel color information from I frames with motion vector information from P frames, uses Markov Random Field to predict pixel locations of an object in future frame
   - Khatoonabadi_2012: Similar to Gül 2016, also uses MRF
   - You_2012
   - Wojaczek_2015: Uses simple shape detector to detect people
   -> usually very fast, but low accuracy

- Modern methods that combine a DL object detector with a tracking stage (expand more on these three papers)
   - Alvar_2018: Uses YOLO detector to decide which of the proposed ROIs is the target object
   - Ujiie_2018: Method very similar to mine, called MVint, uses SqueezeDet detector, considers only I- and P-vectors, fixed GOP size, can not handle different codecs and B vectors
   - Liu_2019: Method very similar to mine, uses a tracking CNN to predict box velocities based on previous bounding boxes (generated by R-FCN with ResNet-101) and motion vectors, uses deep learning network for data association and shares 
   -> general issues with these methods:
       - use fixed GOP size and explicitely perform detection on keyframes rather than any frame
       - use only I- and P-vectors but not B-vectors for simplicity
       - Ujiie method uses very simple box interpolation which does not account for change in box size (my method does neither)
       - Liu_2019 assumes MPEG4 codec and Ujiie compares different codecs
   -> we analyze two trackers of this kind, one using a DL tracking stage and one using a classical tracking stage
   -> the classic method uses the idea of Ujiie to interpolate boxes between frames
   -> we compare various encoder settings and scales in terms of speed and accuracy
