- use H.264 data with interpolated MVS and B/P vectors
- 4 channel MVS with B and P vectors split into individual channels
- change model architecture (more layers, etc.)
- change weight initialization

- increase batch size for regularization
- implement current scaling as custom torch transform
- use transforms to augment training data
