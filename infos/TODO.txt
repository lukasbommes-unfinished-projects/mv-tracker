- validate that inversion of motion vector during flip transform works
- throw away old transforms file and use the new one throughout the code
- rewrite train code to use new transforms
- train neural network with transforms and see if generalization is better
- add more data augmentation (e.g. translation)

- change scale transforms to directly scale boxes, velocities, etc. as well instead of returning scaling factor

- add back the num_boxes_mask so that the model only uses the boxes and not the padded values
