def get_vectors_by_source(motion_vectors, source):
    """Returns subset of motion vectors with a specified source frame.

    The source parameter of a motion vector specifies the temporal position of
    the reference (source) frame relative to the current frame. Each vector
    starts at the point (src_x, sry_y) in the source frame and points to the
    point (dst_x, dst_y) in the current frame. If the source value is for
    example -1, then the reference frame is the previous frame.

    For B frames there are motion vectors which refer macroblocks both to past
    frames and future frames. By setting the source parameter to "past" this
    method filters out motion vectors referring to future frames and returns the
    set of motion vectors which refer to past frames (e.g. the equivalent to the
    motion vectors in P frames). Similarly, by setting the value to "future"
    only vectors referring to future frames are returned.

            source parameter (the location of the reference frame) are selected.

            returned (only for B-frames). If "past" all motion vectors with
            a negative source value are returned.

    Returns:
